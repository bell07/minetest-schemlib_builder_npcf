Builder that walk around and build building
The mod is in early development state
dependencies: 
  - schemlib https://github.com/bell07/minetest-schemlib
    The development going forward in sync. In case of updates please update both mods
  - npcf https://github.com/stujones11/minetest-npcf
    npcf mod only, not the whole pack required

Use the mod in test-worlds only. The NPC is inmortable and unstoppable in his work :/

Usage:
Get the "larry Schemlib (NPC)" node and place to the world
Rightclick and give him a name.
Note: if you place multiple NPC's he will work together
